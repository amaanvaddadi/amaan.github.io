                I am writing this in complete presence. My reflections are spontaneous errands of thought clouds wavering through the wind of time. Erroneous as it may sound, the best of creativity stems from no mind. The state of natural being. The space between me and my mind as a watcher of the thoughts arises a completely new dimension of mind.
            </p>
            <p>
                This attempt to bring out thoughtlessness is as wasteful as the excessive thinking habits humans endure because presence is nothingness and nothingness cannot be described.
            </p>
            <p>
                Be with me in this journey to realise something profound and phenomenal. I will try to explain the unexplainable provided I have your complete presence with me on this journey!
