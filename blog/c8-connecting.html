            <h5> Have you tried using any of the insight and techniques for growing trust and sincerity? How did it go? </h5>
            <p> In real life I have partially adopted certain techniques like listening empathically, being kind and understanding how the person in front of me is the same as me and this gave me tremendous insight on how top strike a balance with individuals. The methods so mentioned in formal and informal situations need to be practiced to see the effectiveness of the method. </p>

            <h5>Try empathic listening - how did it go?</h5>

            <p> I have listened emphatically several times in my life. After going through the reading of this chapter, I decided to try this with my wife. Many a times I was in a situation where I was not in  a mood to listen and she had a bad day at work. This time I decided to listen very carefully and empathically by keeping myself in her place. For some time I was lost in judging her as I felt, I could have done better in her sitaution and wouldnt have had a tough day. But then I realised that she is a different individual than me and handles things differently. After a good hearing I felt the difficulty she might have gone through and gave me a very kind, soft hearted feel to the situation. </p>
            
            <h5>How did you find the loving kindness meditation?</h5>

            <p>When I was a kid, In my school back in India we had to say a daily chant: </p>
            <P>"Om, Sarve bhavantu sukhinaḥ ; Sarve santu nirāmayāḥ ; Sarve bhadrāṇi paśyantu ; Mā kashchit duḥkha bhāgbhavet ; Oṁ Shāntiḥ, Shāntiḥ, Shāntiḥ||"</P>
            
            <p>The simple translation of the above verse is as follows: May all be prosperous and happy, May all be free from illness, May all see what is spiritually uplifting, May no one suffer ; Om peace, peace, peace.</p>
            <p>This daily chant had a deep impact in my daily transactions as we were reminded every day that all living beings are equal and deserve the best of life. Loving kindness meditation reemphasizes and imprints our minds to this very basic undersatnding that we all are one inspite of our differences. This practice has helped me extend my love, appreciation and understanding with people I have worked with.</p>
