            <h2> Wishlist </h2>
            <p>
                My wishlist for developing designs:
                Follow proper HTML structure like creating appropriate DIV's and containers and giving them class and attributes. Would like to play with CSS: margins and padding, display, fonts, text align, adding images and colors.
            </p>
            <h2>Understanding HTML, CSS and DOM </h2>
            <p> These concepts can be simply understood by taking the analogy of a house. A house is made of various rooms, within rooms there are sections that encompass bathroom and wardrobes. Similarly an HTML document has a header, content page and a footer.
                
            If we try and code the house analogy it could look something like this:
            </p>

            <img src="../images/DOM.png" alt ="My Pic" style = "width:900px" height="650">      

           <p>
            As we see in the above diagram, the house is structured in terms of rooms and space it will occupy for every single element in the house. This tree like structure is known as Document Object Model(DOM) tree in Web Development.
               
            CSS would be the styling applied to each room in terms of colors of the wall, choice and placement of furniture, furnishings,etc.
            </p>
            <h2> Boxifying Design and Box Model</h2>
            <p> 
            Boxifying design is designing the websites using a concept of boxes. Before building a webpage, we try and box each visual element in the web design. This technique helps the developer to arrange the elements and structure the code accurately.
                
            In CSS, the term "box model" is used to design and layout HTML elements. A box model essentially considers every HTML element wrapped in a box. A box consists of: borders, margins, padding, and the actual content.
