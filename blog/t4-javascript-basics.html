            <h5> How does JavaScript compare to HTML and CSS? </h5>
            <p>
              Javascript provides functionality and interactivity to a website whereas HTML and CSS provide structure and style. together they provide a unique user experience. Alongside HTML and CSS  Javascript forms the three core technologies of World Wide Web.

            <h5>Explain control flow and loops using an example process from everyday life</h5>

           <p>
           Control flow or flow of control is the order in which function calls, information and statements are executed by the computer when a program is running. A simple example of control flow could be: Suppose I am moving homes and have packed several stuff into different boxes. I have named each box for the ease of recognition. Now i have moved into a new house and wondering where my pan is as i am hungry and looking to make noodles. 
			<p>
			If I explain this concept as a control flow statement. It would look something like this:</p>
				<P>
				box kitchen1 = pans and pots</P>

				<p>if kitchen1 ===pan { "carry the box to the kitchen" }</p>
				<p>else {"Leave this box. Look for another one"}</p>

			<p>The above statement basically would mean that we have to pick up kitchen 1 box consisting of pans and pots and look for the particular pan. If you cant see it in that box, look for another box.</p>

			
			<p>
			Loops execute a command in  a particular range. For example if we need to print numbers between 1 and 10, instead of giving 9 print commands for each number we define a range. A simple example would be : Instead of telling my assistant to get pan one from kitchen box 1, pan 2 from kitchen box 2 , etc .. I tell him to get kitchen box 1 which contains all the pans. </p>
			<p>
			It could be written as: for (var kitchen1 = pan1, kitchen1<10, kitchen1++)
            </p>
        


            <h5>Explain the difference between accessing data from arrays and object literals</h5>

           <p>
           In Javascript, both arrays and objects are handled identically because arrays are merely special kind of object. data from arrays can be retrieved using the index number from 0 to any within that array. Object literal properties or methods can be accessed by objectName.propertyName or objectName.methodName(). The advantage of using Objects is that data can be easily retrieved from a object with several arrays and variables. for example, If a person wants to retrieve contact numbers from a particular list he can do so easily.

			<h5>Explain what functions are and why they are useful.</h5>

           <p>
           A function is a block of code designed to perform a particular task. A program often needs to perform the same tasks at differnt places. Repeating are necessary statements everytime is tedious and prone to errors. Functions are canned codes a program can go through whenever it wants.  For example, a formula function can be accessed at several places to get results.
