                EDA employs a learning environment where everyone takes ownership of their bootcamp and walks with a perspective of learning and committing themselves towards achieving common goals. Students irrespective of their background are encouraged to participate and engage in groupwork. Its an approach that completely appeals to me, as I have always believed in the potential that humans collabratively manifest. Successful organisations have believed in the culture of synergies where people of different intellectual and personal capabilities share a common goal, and work towards it taking complete ownership with the task at hand. 
            </p>
            <p>
                 Amazing results can be achieved by walking through fearlessly, being completely in the present and focussing on tasks a step at a time. I joined EDA with this expectation of solving problems and see myself fitting well with this learning environment.
            </p>
            <p>
               I am very excited to be part of EDA's challenging and fun environment!
