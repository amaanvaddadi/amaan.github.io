               'Search Inside Yourself' drops you down to a level of thought that is inspiring and life changing. The very idea of mindfullness repeats the ancinet zen and buddhist philosphies of searching your true self, the independent being or as some say " just be"!

            This book painstakingly proves that benefits of meditation can be scientifically proven. Considerable research satisfies an engineering mind on the significant impact meditation has on human beings. By exploring the 'happiest man on earth' Meng beckons our attention towards correlation of Happines to emotional intelligence to productivity.
            
            Emotional intelligence (E.I.) has amazing improvements on work performance and leadership the core requirements for achievers in the tech sector.

            <p>
                  Cultivating E.I. is one's concious effort to train attention and focus towards a singlr point without judging. Meng suggests mindfullness in 2 minutes which primarily tells us
                to focus attention on breathing, have absolutely no agenda and shift from doing to being in those 2 mins

            <p>
                Practicing 2 minutes of meditation and mindfullness is an experience that probably cannot be mentioned in words. Words could just describe an individuals feelings but not the true experience. Peace and joy was something that could be experienced. Suddenly I was alive and silent.
