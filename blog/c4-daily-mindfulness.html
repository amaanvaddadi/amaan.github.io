            <h5> What did you learn from your 'mindfulness conversation'? How did the other person find it? </h5>
            <p>
              Mindful conversations where I am able to provide complete attention to my wife has been the most wonderful experience. Though I have not put into practice the methods so mentioned in this book but me and my wife have been communicating with complete mindfulness. I have been able to understand my wife better, I never recognised before that she had a great voice and moreover I realised that she is an amazing human being full of wisdom and insight.

                      
            </p>

              <p>The methods so mentioned in this book where we allocate time to listen with complete mindfulness and looping and providing feedback is worth trying</p>
           
          

            <h5>Which of the three suggested techniques will you use to sustain your practice?</h5>

           <p>
           I have been practicing mindful food habits and also looking forward to practicing mindful walks.  </p>
		
            <h5>My views</h5>

           <p>
           Search inside Yourself is gradually, training (if I may use that word) you to become more aware of the present moment. I have been practising present moment awareness for past couple of years and have realsied the benefits of the same. My life has been more productive and most importantly peaceful and happier than I have ever been in my life. The insights in this book are profound and will help humankind achieve peace and happiness. </p>
