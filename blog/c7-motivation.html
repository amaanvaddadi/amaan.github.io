                <h3>Motivation</h3>
        </div>

        <div class="content2">
            <h5> How does life look through the 'pleasure, passion and purpose' lens? </h5>
            <p> Pleasure, passion and purpose lens defines the very root of sustainale happiness and clarfies where we need to focus our attention more to remain more productive and happy. This insight suggests that to remain motivated at work one needs to first find higher purpose in life. This higher purpose is defined by what we value the most and what is most meaningful to us. This leads us to stop looking for happiness in pleasure centered activities. Also our seeking for happiness is no more defined by our circumstances or pleasure but roots from a deep level of value and motivational element. </p>

            <h5>From the 'discovering values and higher purpose' exercise, what are your core values? What do you stand for?</h5>

            <p>My core values are Unity, Equality for all beings, Creativity, Empathy. I stand for:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>I stand to provide justice.</li>
                <li>I stand to provide knowledge of the self and bring harmony.</li>
                <li>I stand to look deeper at the meaning of existence and how it can unite the earth.</li>
                <li>I stand to look deeper at the meaning of existence and how it can unite the earth.</li>
                <li>I stand to bring a balance in body, mind and being.</li>
                <li>I stand to bring richness in life in all spheres.</li>
                <li>I stand to bring peace in my life and people around me.</li>
            </ul>
            <h5>How did you find the resilience ideas and meditation exercise?</h5>

            <p>The best way to always come back in a sitaution is by deeply practicing the present. I have in my life been through several ups and downs and the only thing that kept me going were strong silence, living in the moment and dying every moment to the past. daily meditation in the form of formal exercises and active presence has helped me anchor myself in the deep calm of the ocean irrespective of the tides. I have experienced supreme bliss in this process.</p>
