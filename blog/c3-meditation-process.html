        	<h5 > Process over product in web design </h5>
            
        	<p>
        
				Process over product I assume is the quintessence of any quality work. I am reminded of Dr Demings ' total quality approch' which primarily lays impetus on focussing on quality improvement at every step of production process. Process led me to adapting a plan, focus on implementing it at every stage. I individually keep the product in mind and design the process to reach that goal. As a student and learner I see the wisdom on focusing on the process and constantly refining it will eventually produce great results!

            <h5> What did you think about meditation before reading chapter 2? </h5>

            <p>
                  Through-out my life time i have been lucky to have come across meditation and its practices. My introduction to meditation happened in early childhood as a part of our school curriculum. I have always felt that meditation improves focus and attention and definetely keeps you a happier being.
                
            </p>
            <h5> What new things have you learnt about meditation? </h5>
            
            <p>
             	'Search inside yourself' has convinced me scientifically the benefits of meditation. I have learnt simple techniques of mindfullness meditation by bringing attention to your breath, sitting postures and guide to improve focus in a situation of distractions. What fascinates me the most is the realisation that the end goal of a meditator is to gain deeper insight of his mind. Drawing parallel to the analogy of 'a torch with bright light' opens up a dimension that I definetely look forward to seek.  
            </p>
       
            <h5> Did any of the suggested meditation techniques stand out to you? </h5>
            
            <p>
                Breathing technique as suggested as a way to practice mindfullness meditation, alongwith posture and techniques to bring mind to breathing has been tried before and definetely the way to go.   
            </p>
       		
            <h5> My thoughts </h5>
            
            <p>
                Most amazing fact is the idea of meditation to improve health. I am not very sure how that is possible but isn't it true as the age old wisdom goes 'a happy person seldom falls sick'. If mindfullness meditation improves quality of thoughts and health I think it should be the first habit to adopt. Looking forward to make mindfullness a part of my daily life!
