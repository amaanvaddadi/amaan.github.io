            <h5> What is the relationship between mindfulness and self awareness? </h5>
            <p>
              
              Mindfulness and self awareness mean the same. In a mindful state a person can be aware of his emotions, look at himself and do an accurate assessment and get a sense of his self worth and capabilities. Both necessarily require a person to look at himself as a third person looking at his mind.
                      
            </p>
          

            <h5>Try at least one of the self awareness practices from the chapter (Body Scan, Journaling). What was your experience of it? How did you feel?</h5>

           <p>
           Practicing Journaling was an amazing experience. I used one of the prompts to write whatever I felt. It was for the first time I was just typing whatever came to my mind. This exercise helped me be completely aware of what I was feeling at that particular moment. A regular practice would open up insights into my strengths and weaknesses and help me correct myself towards being better person.    </p>
		
            <h5>What did you take away from the "My Emotions are Not Me" section?</h5>

           <p>
           I am not my mind. Simply put, I am an entity independent of the mind who can watch the mind. This watcher awakens a reality that mind and body both are separate from the 'I' or 'Me'. All emotions which are a part of mind and body phenomena are not who we really are. This awareness shifts consciousness from "I am angry" to "I feel anger in my body". The I attached to the emotion disappears. </p>
