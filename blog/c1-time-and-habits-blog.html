               " We are what we repeatedly do. Excellence then, is not an act, but a habit." - Aristotle

                  Habits are the key to achieving things. Tiny habits everyday help achieve amazing results. I have always believed in meditating as a habit. Be completely conscious of every action and be aware and mindful of everything I do. This practice has helped me gain immense satisfaction and has resulted in great productivity. The techniques that I believe worked wonderfully for me is mindfullness and tiny habits.

              Tiny habits are an excellent way of cultivating habits without realising the underlying power tiny actions can achieve. I realised that from past several months I have been unsuccessfully trying to strengthen my shoulder following an accident. A part of the reason for failure, is my lack of discipline to excercise the shoulder everyday. Following Fogg's method I tried one push up after every article I read. Interestingly I believe that continuous association with an existing habit will improve my shoulder strength and make me better.  The Pomodoro technique of splitting an activity into 20 mins activity giving it full concentration appeals to me. I have not yet tried the Pomodoro method but surely am going to give it a try!

            I am surely going to adapt mindfullness, complete present moment awareness as a method of meditation along with Tiny Habits of Fogg.
